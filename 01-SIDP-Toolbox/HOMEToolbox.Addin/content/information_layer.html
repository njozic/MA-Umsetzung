<h1>System Architecture - Information Layer</h1>
<div>
	The instantiation of the physical components together with their instantiated security requirements states the basis for the architectural development. In a first step the <i>Business Context View</i> as part of the <i>SGAM Information Layer</i> can be developed. This view aims at depicting the <i>Information Object Flows</i> among the participating physical components and can be derived by considering (1) the detailed description of all involved PUC's and (2) the mapping from <i>Logical Actors</i> onto <i>Physical Components</i>. Figure 1 depicts the <i>Business Context View</i> for the "Control Reactive Power of DER" HLUC.

	The second specified view on the <i>SGAM Information Layer</i> is the <i>Canonical Data Model</i>. This view deals with the assignment of appropriate data model standards to be used. Selecting the best fitting standard requires detailed considerations. As discussed in Section Standards Mapping, the <i>IEC Smart Grid Standards Mapping Tool</i> can deliver guidance for choosing appropriate standards. However, for the given example mainly CIM and IEC 61850 related standards have been selected as can be seen in Figure 2.

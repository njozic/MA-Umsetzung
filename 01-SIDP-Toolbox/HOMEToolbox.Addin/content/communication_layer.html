<h1>System Architecture - Communication Layer</h1>
<div>
	Developing the <i>SGAM Communication Layer</i> is quite similar to the development of the <i>SGAM Information Layer</i>. The already existing components with their realized interfaces can be placed within the concerning diagram. Again, the <i>IEC Smart Grids Standards Mapping Tool</i> provides guidance on the selection of appropriate communication protocols which are integrated in the model as <i>Communication Relation</i>. Figure 1 depicts the <i>SGAM Communication Layer</i> for the example with the selected communication protocols.
